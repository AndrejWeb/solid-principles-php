# Interface Segregation Principle

#### A client should not be forced to depend on interfaces it does not use.

ISP suggests that it's better to have many specific interfaces for a class rather than a single large, general-purpose interface. Clients should only be required to implement the methods that are relevant to their needs, and they should not be forced to implement irrelevant methods.
