# Single Responsibility Principle

#### A class should have only one reason to change.

The SRP suggests that a class should have only one responsibility or job and should focus on performing that responsibility well. It should not be responsible for multiple, unrelated tasks, as this can lead to a tightly coupled and less maintainable codebase.
