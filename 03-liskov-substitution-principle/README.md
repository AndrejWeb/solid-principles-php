# Liskov Substitution Principle

#### Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program.

If you have a base class and subclasses that inherit from it, you should be able to use any subclass object interchangeably with the base class object without introducing unexpected behaviors or breaking the program.
